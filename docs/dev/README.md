## General guidelines
As an open source project, we absolutely encourage contributions from the community to help Testrun remain an expanding but stable product. However, before contributing there are a number of things to take into consideration.

1) [Sign the Google CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/): Whether you are an individual or contributing on behalf of your organisation, you must be covered by a Google CLA.

2) Determine the scope of your contribution

    - Your contribution is more likely to be accepted if fewer files are changed (keep it simple)
    - Are you going to be fixing a bug, dependency issue or a new framework capability? Whatever it is, ensure your pull request fixes or changes just one thing.

3) Get in touch to discuss whether your proposed changes are likely to be accepted

    - It is best to get the opinion from the core maintainers whether your proposed changes meet our objectives and align with Testrun principles.

4) Fork Testrun and get developing

    - We aim to provide thorough and easy to ready developer documentation to help you contribute successfully.
