## Identifying network interfaces

For Testrun to operate correctly, you must select the correct network interfaces within the settings panel of the user interface. There are 2 methods to identify the correct network interfaces:

A) Find the printed MAC address on your interface

Some USB network interfaces will have the MAC address printed on the interface itself. This will look something like: ```00:e0:4c:02:0f:a8```.

Compare this printed MAC address against the MAC address provided in the settings panel in the user interface.

B) Connect your interfaces one at a time

  1) Ensure both interfaces are disconnected from your PC and open the settings panel in the user interface.

  2) Connect your internet interface to your PC and refresh the settings panel. One interface, which was not previously present, should now be visibile.

  3) Repeat the previous step for the devices interface.
