# Connection Test Module

The connection test module runs a collection of tests around the IP and DHCP connectivity between the device and the provided network services.

## What's inside?

The ```bin``` folder contains the startup script for the module.

The ```config/module_config.json``` file provides the name and description of the module, and specifies which tests will be caried out.

Within the ```python/src``` directory, the below tests are executed. A few dhcp utility methods are included in ```python/src/dhcp_util.py```.

## Tests covered

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior | Required Result |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| connection.port_link         | The network switch port connected to the device has an active link without errors | When the etherent cable is connected to the port, the device triggers the port to its enabled \"Link UP\" (LEDs illuminate on device and switch ports if present) state, and the switch shows no errors with the LEDs and when interrogated with a \"show interface\" command on most network switches. | Required        |
| connection.port_speed        | The network switch port connected to the device has auto-negotiated a speed that is 10 Mbps or higher | When the ethernet cable is connected to the port, the device autonegotiates a speed that can be checked with the \"show interface\" command on most network switches.  The output of this command must also show that the \"configured speed\" is set to \"auto\". | Required        |
| connection.port_duplex       | The network switch port connected to the device has auto-negotiated full-duplex. | When the ethernet cable is connected to the port, the device autonegotiates a full-duplex connection. | Required        |
| connection.switch.arp_inspection | The device implements ARP correctly as per RFC826 | Device continues to operate correctly when ARP inspection is enabled on the switch.  No functionality is lost with ARP inspection enabled. | Required        |
| connection.switch.dhcp_snooping | The device operates as a DHCP client and operates correctly when DHCP snooping is enabled on a switch. | Device continues to operate correctly when DHCP snooping is enabled on the switch. | Required        |
| connection.dhcp_address      | The device under test has received an IP address from the DHCP server and responds to an ICMP echo (ping) request | The device is not set up with a static IP address. The device accepts an IP address from a DHCP server (RFC 2131) and responds successfully to an ICMP echo (ping) request. | Required        |
| connection.mac_address       | Check and note device physical address. | N/A | Required |
| connection.mac_oui | The device under test has a MAC address prefix that is registered against a known manufacturer. | The MAC address prefix is registered in the IEEE Organizationally Unique Identifier database. | Required |
| connection.private_address   | The device under test accepts an IP address that is compliant with RFC 1918 Address Allocation for Private Internets. | The device under test accepts IP addresses within all ranges specified in RFC 1918 and communicates using these addresses. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix), 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix), 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix). | Required |
| connection.shared_address    | Ensure the device supports RFC 6598 IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space | The device under test accepts IP addresses within the range specified in RFC 6598 and communicates using these addresses. | Required |
| connection.dhcp_disconnect   | The device under test issues a new DHCPREQUEST packet after a port ph ysical disconnection and reconnection. | A client SHOULD use DHCP to reacquire or verify its IP address and network parameters whenever the local network parameters may have changed; e.g., at system boot time or after a disconnection from the local network, as the local network configuration may change without the client's or user's knowledge. If a client has knowledge ofa  previous network address and is unable to contact a local DHCP server, the client may continue to use the previous network addres until the lease for that address expires.  If the lease expires before the client can contact a DHCP server, the client must immediately discontinue use of the previous network address and may inform local users of the problem. | Required        |
| connection.dhcp_disconnect_ip_change | When device is disconnected,  update device IP on the DHCP server and reconnect the device. Ensure device received new IP address. | If IP address for a device was changed on the DHCP server while the device was disconnected then the device should request and update the new IP upon reconnecting to the network | Required        |
| connection.single_ip         | The network switch port connected to the device reports only one IP address for the device under test.               | The device under test does not behave as a network switch and only requests one IP address. This test is to avoid that devices implement network switches that allow connecting strings of daisy-chained devices to one single network port, as this would not make 802.1x port-based authentication possible. | Required        |
| connection.target_ping       | The device under test responds to an ICMP echo (ping) request.                                                      | The device under test responds to an ICMP echo (ping) request.                                                                                                        | Required        |
| connection.ipaddr.ip_change  | The device responds to a ping (ICMP echo request) to the new IP address it has received after the initial DHCP lease has expired. | If the lease expires before the client receives a DHCPACK, the client moves to the INIT state, MUST immediately stop any other network processing, and requires network initialization parameters as if the client were uninitialized. If the client then receives a DHCPACK allocating the client its previous network address, the client SHOULD continue network processing. If the client is given a new network address, it MUST NOT continue using the previous network address and SHOULD notify the local users of the problem. | Required        |
| connection.ipaddr.dhcp_failover | The device has requested a DHCPREQUEST/REBIND to the DHCP failover server after the primary DHCP server has been brought down. |                                                                                                                                                                       | Required        |
| connection.ipv6_slaac        | The device forms a valid IPv6 address as a combination of the IPv6 router prefix and the device interface identifier | The device under test complies with RFC4862 and forms a valid IPv6 SLAAC address.                                                                                    | Required        |
| connection.ipv6_ping         | The device responds to an IPv6 ping (ICMPv6 Echo) request to the SLAAC address                                      | The device responds to the ping as per RFC4443                                                                                                                        | Required        |
